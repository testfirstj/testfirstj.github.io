== Java Modules and Testing

.Encapsulation gone wrong: So much for shining security armor.
image:shiningArmor-cropped.png[role="thumb left", 400, title="So much for shining security armor"] Project Jigsaw,
now known as the **J**ava **P**latform **M**odule **S**ystem solves problems
that lingered in the Java ecosystem since its inception. The standard encapsulation or visibility model
with protection or visibility modes `private`, `package private (default)` provide too
little defense against (ab)use of non-public API's. That plus the fact that reflection is very powerful.
A java security manager can put up some defense against reflection abuse, but enabling this kind of security is optional.footnote:[It was enforced in the now deprecated web applets]
This made many internal details of the JDK free game. Much like a knight in shiny armor is defenseless against a can opener.

[TIP]
====
The java platform module system (JPMS) promotes loose coupling.
====

This is all fine and good, but testing, in particular Unit testing relies on access to the 'private' parts
of a class and package, in particular the package private parts.

[TIP]
====
API or **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface is defined as the publicly visible
parts of classes. In Java those are *public* and *protected* members (methods and fields).
Members that are neither public or protected should not be considered part of the API.

Actually, API in this case should be spelled APPI for **A**pplication **P**ublic **P**rogramming **I**nterface, but we all know
bad habits die slowly.

A smaller API has also a smaller attack surface for real security intrusions. This is another major reason for improved encapsulation of the
stuff in the JDK.

To minimize coupling, it is also wise to keep the API minimal, but without impairing the usefulness of the
API. Often an API can be enhanced with some convenience features that combine parts in the already public part. This does NOT enlarge exposed parts.
See for instance the methods in
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html[java.nio.file.Files].

=== Black box vs White Box

In testing, one distinguishes between so called *black* box and *white* box tests.

*Black box* in this respect means that you cannot see the internals, but only those parts defined in the API.
This is the way that a client package will use the API. Black box testing is easily supported by the module system, because the test classes behave as ordinary
clients. +
*White box* would better be called _transparent_ box, but the name _white box_ stuck. In white box tests you *DO* want access to the (package) private parts
of your business code. This is a bit handicapped by the way the JPMS allows access.

=== Standard Source code organization.


//image::sourcetree-modular.png[title='default source tree ']

.source tree of genericdao (command tree - -UL 3 src/main/)
[source,sh]
----
src
└── main
    ├── java
        ├── module-info.java #<1>
        └── genericdao
            ├── dao
            ├── memory
            └── pgdao
----

<1> module-info.java at the root of the java sources.

We are using maven, in which the unit test plugin is called *surefire*, the integration test plugin (which we
  did not use up to this point yet) is called *failsafe*.

The standard way source code is organized is by means of separate directories for
the 'business' code and the test code in two separate directory trees inside the same project. +
This practice, which prevents test code to land in the final application or library jar file is useful, so we will keep it as it is.

However, JPMS does not allow so called _split packages_. Surefire addresses this problem by telling
the JVM to _patch_ the module we are testing with the classes defined in the test source tree.
It is as if the test classes are put in the business source tree. +
This allows the test classes access to the package private parts of the classes, the way it worked in before JPMS.

.Module definition of sebi dao.
[source,java]
----
module nl.fontys.sebidao {
    exports nl.fontys.sebivenlo.dao;
    exports nl.fontys.sebivenlo.dao.memory;
    exports nl.fontys.sebivenlo.dao.pg;
    requires java.logging;
    requires java.naming;
    requires java.sql;
    requires org.postgresql.jdbc;
}
----

// .The dependency graph of sebidao
// image::sebidao-summary.svg[]

The module definition above exports three packages and declares itself
dependent on 3 modules from Java API and one postgresql module.

Unit tests, and in particular the testing libraries such as AssertJ, and Mockito
use reflection to do their work. The simplest example is JUnit itself, which uses reflection to read the annotations
in the class file. So does Mockito. AssertJ uses reflection to get to fields (for deepEquals) and methods. Reflection is a tool very sharp indeed, to
get to the guts of the **S**ystem **U**nder **T**est. Of these Test libraries JUnit and AssertJ have module definitions already. Mockito and postgresql do not have that
at the time of writing this document (April 2020).

The quickest way to allow the testing tools access is to fully OPEN the packages of the *SUT* to world.
Because this happens during testing, surefire is instructed to tell the jvm (java), that runs the test, to
open those packages to the world. The snippet from the maven pom file that realizes that is given below. You can copy
and adapt it for your own purposes.

.sebipom project with surefire.opens property to open op required packages for testing. Requires sebipom >= 3.0.2
[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
    <surefire.opens> <!--1-->
        --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/genericdao.dao=ALL-UNNAMED <!--2-->
        --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/genericdao.memory=ALL-UNNAMED
        --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/genericdao.pgdao=ALL-UNNAMED
        --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/usertypes=ALL-UNNAMED
        --add-opens nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao/entities=ALL-UNNAMED,genericmapper
    </surefire.opens>
    <!--3-->
  </properties>
----

<1> We are adding a property for the surefire plugin which is picked up by sebipom.
<2> In particular the arguments that are passed to the JVM that runs the tests,
  which appends *--add-opens* commands for all packages that require unit tests.
<3> Other properties are left out for brevity.

[TIP]
The above requires sebipom version 3.0.2 or higher as parent for your project. Also works
if the parent of your modular maven project uses sebipom as parent.

Of particular importance, and project specific are the [blue]`--add-opens` commands, which you must adapt to your own project's
pom file with your own module and package names.

*Opens* is the most powerful way of exporting a package. It allows full access (as in `exports`) plus reflection.
We could try to make more specific export lines such as *--add-export*, but although more precise, that will not help very much, because the
access enabling lines will only take effect during the (surefire) unit tests. +
If you have _failsafe_ integration tests, you will have to do
the same for the _failsafe_ plugin, although failsafe tests should stick to black box testing, where such can opener style configuration should not be required.
