== Code Coverage and Code Complexity

image::jacoco-profile.png[role="thumb right", title="select jacoco profile"]
A popular and readily available method to get some estimate of
the value of your tests is how much of the code it 'covers', that is executes.
If all is well (TDD), it is easy to  reach 100% code lines covered, including every
branch or loop. Sometimes those nasty *checked* exceptions are in the way, because you either
have to catch them and have a hard time reaching that catch block, because it is hard to setup
a test case where the required exception actually occurs, thereby excluding the catch block from coverage. +

In testeasypom we provide Jacoco as the coverage plugin.
You must activate it using a maven profile.

=== Measuring Code Coverage

image::coverage-report.png[title='activating the jacoco maven plugin after selecting the profile']

Measuring coverage involves a technique that is called instrumenting the (business) code.
To do that effectively, the instrumenting agent inserts something like a flagging statement at the
beginning of each method and of each branch or loop. Jacoco calls it a probe.

To show this, compare the bytecode ( using `javap -v Fraction.class`) of the method Fraction plus(Fraction) and its instrumented version.

.Java source code snippet
[source,java]
----
    public Fraction plus( Fraction other ) {
        return plus( other.num, other.denom );
    }
----

.Orginal byte code
[source,java]
----
public fraction.Fraction plus(fraction.Fraction);
  descriptor: (Lfraction/Fraction;)Lfraction/Fraction;
  flags: (0x0001) ACC_PUBLIC
  Code:
    stack=3, locals=2, args_size=2
       0: aload_0
       1: aload_1
       2: getfield      #6                  // Field num:I
       5: aload_1
       6: getfield      #7                  // Field denom:I
       9: invokevirtual #9                  // Method plus:(II)Lfraction/Fraction;
      12: areturn
    LineNumberTable:
      line 80: 0
    LocalVariableTable:
      Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
          0      13     0  this   Lfraction/Fraction;
          0      13     1 other   Lfraction/Fraction;

You can imagine that instrumenting will slow your code down, however, it makes no functional changes.
If your read the above code and comments we added, you see that whenever this method is executed, the 9th Boolean in the jacoco coverage array is set to one.

Having only a Boolean per code-path is well a considered compromise. If you would like to count the number of executions,
the probe-code would get longer and the execution substantially slower (updating counts, etc). Jacoco chose this solution, cobertura another once popular coverage tool the other.
You see that this efficient code probing can have a serious impact on the number of instructions for short (e.g. one statement) methods.

We showed a simple example of a straight through method. When a method has loops or branches each of those
will have a probe of its own. From this you can infer the the coverage agent needs to know about these loops and branches and
uses them for another purpose too.

=== Code Complexity

image::Control_flow_graph_of_function_with_loop_and_an_if_statement_without_loop_back.svg[role="thumb left", title="from wikipedia"]
Complex code is never a good thing. It is hard to write, hard to read and therefor hard to maintain, and all in all expensive.
This simplest code is just a list of assignments and method calls, properly mixed to make it's execution meaningful.
Such code would count as one code block and only needs one probe.

Introducing one or more branches increases complexity, and because paths after these branches can exclude one another, thereby increasing that chance that
one or the other code-path is not executed.

This complexity can be computed from the number of code-paths found.
This complexity computation also know as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity[McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity].

When using jacoco, you get this complexity computation for free, because it is useful in the context of code coverage AND
jacoco already has all the data.

.High complexity leads to low coverage. The highlighted column is the most interesting.
image::high-complex.png[]

In the jacoco report above you see the complexity ranging from 1 to 19.
As a rule of thumb, something above 5 is reason for concern, with the exception of the `boolean equals(Object)` method, that starts with three and grows
by one with every field considered in the equals method. According to the doc, there are ways to exclude equals from the jacoco report, but that will be for another time.

.Low complexity means easier in everything including in reaching high coverage.

The second jacoco report is the same application implemented by a different developer. Here the complexity ranges from 1 to 5 which
leads to way easier to maintain code.

====
If you got curious about java byte code, the byte code listing above were generated as follows

`mvn clean compile` +
`javap -v target/classes/fraction/Fraction.class > Fraction.class-orig.txt` +
`mvn jacoco:instrument` +
`javap -v target/classes/fraction/Fraction.class > Fraction.class-instrumented.txt`

and then editing out the relevant pieces for this narrative.
