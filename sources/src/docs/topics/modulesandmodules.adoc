== Modules and Modules

Maven has modules too, and that already for a long time. Maven modules however are not modules
in the Java 9 sense. Maven modules are to be understood as a collection of coherent projects
that are split up into smaller projects. Each smaller project is a _module_ that produces separate artifacts such as jar or war files.
Either because the components are not deployed as one on one machine, or because of potential separate reuse of sub sets of the components.

=== Java 9 Modules and Testing

A project intended as  java module project should

* declare the API of that module as in what packages are exported (`exports`), and optionally to whom,
* who is allow to reflect on what part of the API (Optional) (`open` or `opens`)
* what services it provides (optional)
* and on what modules itself depends. `requires`.

.Example module-info.java from https://github.com/sebivenlo/sebidao[sebidao]
[source,java]
----
module nl.fontys.sebidao {
    exports io.github.sebivenlo.dao;
    exports io.github.sebivenlo.dao.memory;
    exports io.github.sebivenlo.dao.pg;
    requires java.logging;
    requires java.naming;
    requires java.sql;
    requires org.postgresql.jdbc;
}

If you have java classes in packages, whose use in a context requires reflection, then you must `open`
those packages to the reflecting modules. As an example: JUnit uses reflection to find the annotations in the test classes,
so you typically need to open up your test classes for JUnit. The same goes for Mockito and other tools that are used during testing.
Opening up everything just for testing sounds a bit scary and if it would be needed, it would defeat the purpose of the
java 9 module system in the first place.

The virtual machine has two ways to find classes:

. The class-path, which is the traditional way.
. The module-path, which is the java 9 way.

Ideally, when your modern java 9 application is deployed, it will use the module path.
However, based on the absolute need for backward compatibility, the class path can still be used
and opens up some ways to temporarily at least open up a module without its cooperation.

This works as of 2020-05-15 as follows, and can be used for testing.

For those packages/classes that need reflective access by some test module or library,
you can open up the packages by adding a configuration for the maven surefire test plugin that tells the JVM to
open up the packages that are used in the tests.

[source,xml]
----
<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
          <!-- add add-opens lines for all packages in your module that are tested.
              For testing it is fine to open your packages for the whole world, which includes
              e.g. junit, assertj, and mockito.
              Also leave ${atgLine} because it is set/used by the coverage plugin.
          -->
          <argLine>
              ${argLine}
              --add-opens sebidaodemo/demo=ALL-UNNAMED
              --add-opens sebidaodemo/entities=ALL-UNNAMED
              --add-opens sebidaodemo/pgtypes=ALL-UNNAMED
          </argLine>
      </configuration>
----

In the plugin configuration, the package `demo`, `entities`, and `pgtypes` are all opened to to the "unnamed modules", which
are all libraries loaded via the class path. Because this configuration is only whilst running the tests, it is fine.
