== Code quality, not just in testing

One easily forgets that one of the most important qualities of
good source code is _readability_. If the code is incomprehensible to the reader,
and that might be you in 6 weeks time, than that code is not maintainable. It's fate
will be: Try what it does, then rewrite it from scratch and put the original in the trash can.

Readability is a feature that is influenced by code style, proper naming,footnote:[One of the really difficult problems in informatics]
and documentation.

In all cases you may assume a versed reader of java code. You are about to be one.

If you write code and then have write an explanation on how it works, you should rewrite the code instead. Typically
you selected the wrong names. Code should be readable as a story.
Renaming methods and fields is easy with an IDE, it is called refactoring.

=== The compiler: Semantic correctness

The first line of defense against errors is the compiler. It is probably the first reader of your code.
It will flag when it can't make sense of your code or when you used an illegal construct
or a statement that is syntactically wrong..

=== Checkstyle and friends

Apart from testing, the java world has a plethora of quality verification tools.
Many of these can be configured as maven plugins and indeed, the sebi pom has a few.

*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkstyle[checkstyle]* Does a source code analysis and comments on the way your code is formatted, placement of your curly braces, white space,
naming conventions, javadoc etc. +
*https://pmd.github.io/[pmd]* Analyses the source code but now scans for coding defects. +
*https://spotbugs.github.i[spotbugs]* The successor of findbugs does code analysis on the byte code level.

You can easily run all these plugins by calling maven as `mvn site`. It will, on success,
produce a website inside your target folder, aptly calls `target/site`. Use your browser to open it
or open the target/site folder in the files tab of the IDE and right-click view on index.html.

You can find the link:../sebivenlo_checks.xml[sebivenlo_checks.xml ^]footnote:[will be maintaned at the same place where you find testeasypom.] check-style rules on this server by following the link 9 word to the left.

[WARNING]
====
The source code repository has been configured to check your code with check-style in a pre-commit hook.
We insist that you format your code properly and add documentation where required. We use the *google java style*, with a few tweaks.

[role="red"]*The bottom line is: Apply the proper Java code  style, or your code will not be accepted by the versioning system.*
====

The tools above are complementary and help to improve your code quality.
Since you are supposed to be a learner, accept the given advise, even if it is from a program, and use
it to improve your coding style.

[TIP]
====
If you are about to commit your solution to the PRC2 repo, and all tests pass, run `mvn site` in the root of your project
or run maven from netbeans with target site:site. If all is well, you have a nice website with
a lot of reports, including dependency info, javadoc of both business code and test code, and checkstyle,  pmd, and spotbugs reports.

*Note* that some plugins will refuse to work when the project does not pass the tests.

If your commit is not accepted due to checkstyle issues, look at the checkstyle report.
You can also run checkstyle from NetBeans/maven : run maven goal `checkstyle:checkstyle`. If it is not okay, you will see
the problems in the output window.
====

[TIP]
====
*WHAT*, not _how_. +
Your class and method documentation should document what the class/method does, not how it does it.
If required, you should document the constraints on the parameters and of the state the object before you may
call a method.
====

=== Where is javadoc required?

The short list is:
Javadoc is required for all *public* or *protected* _members_ and _constructors_.

In detail:

* On the class (or interface) declaration.
* all (visible) methods (or constructors) with more than 2 lines of code.

No javadoc is required for methods annotated with `@Test` or `@ParameterizedTest`
or methods that overwrite a definition in a super type (class or interface) which is already documented.
In such case you can (and probably should) inherit the documentation.

[TIP]
====
Of course you can teach NetBeans to have all your code comply with a code style
that is acceptable by checkstyle. Here you can find my link:../topics/netbeans-settings-hom.zip[editor settings].
Import them into NetBeans and after that, you can make your code look really good (to my eyes and at least to checkstyle), by pressing kbd:[Alt+Shift+F]. +
On a Mac that is different. But you knew that.
