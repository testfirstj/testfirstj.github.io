== Service class Self registration.

Some services provided by classes are greatly helped if the
using class does not have to instantiate a class, but can simple look it up.

Looking up an object instead of creating your own instance can also help performance, because
an next lookup can return the same object, so the expense of the instantiation
is paid only once, when creating the first instance. This can make an expensive construct still usable, once
the instance is used often enough. This trades startup cost for flexibility and less
repetitive programmer's (you) work.

This looking up is done in something called a [blue]*registry*.
// To be able to find such a registry, a registry itself is often implemented as a Singleton

How cool would it be that a service like a Deconstructor could register itself, by supplying
the key (the class of the entity it can deconstruct) and as value itself. Then the client code (the method that wants to do the deconstucting) can simply
look up the deconstructor

[source,java]
----
  void useEntity( E e ) {

    for (Object f : Deconstructor.forType( e.getClass() ).deconstruct( e ) ) {
      // use fields.
    }
  }
----

To make this work, we need to do a bit of designing, a class diagram will help.
//Sometime you need to load a class _by hand_, to make it available for use or inspection.

.A subclass registering it self in a superclass.

The self registration works by the fact that the class loader initializes the class,
which include executing the static blocks in the code.

The registry can now be implemented as follows:

.Loading a class that then self registers.
[source,java]
----
public abstract class Deconstructor<E> {

    private static final ConcurrentMap<Class<?>, Deconstructor<?>> register
         = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public static <E> Deconstructor<E> forType( Class<E> et ) {
        if ( !register.containsKey( et ) ) {
            loadDeconstructorClass( et );
        } // assume loading is successful
        return (Deconstructor<E>) register.get( et );
    }

    private static <E> void loadDeconstructorClass( Class<E> forEntity ) {
        String deconstructorName = forEntity.getName() + "Deconstructor";
        try {
            Class.forName( deconstructorName, true, forEntity.getClassLoader() );
        } catch ( ClassNotFoundException ex ) {
            Logger.getLogger( Deconstructor.class.getName() ).log( Level.SEVERE,
                    ex.getMessage() );
        }
    }

    protected static void register( Class<?> et, Deconstructor<?> dec ) {
        register.put( et, dec );
    }

    /**
     * Method to be implemented by (potentially generated) leaf deconstructors.
     *
     * @param entity to deconstruct
     * @return field values in array
     */
    public abstract Object[] deconstruct( E entity );
}
----

.Self registration in a subclass
[source,java]
----
class StudentDeconstructor extends Deconstructor<Student> {

  private StudentDeconstructor(){
    // do what is needed to make this a valid object
    // or leave empty to suppress a default constructor.
  }

  /**
   * Static block to self register.
   */
  static {
    Registry.register( Student.class, new StudentDeconstructor() );
  }

  // other details left out
}
----

Note that the self registering class does not have to be public, so you can keep
it nicely tucked away as a package private XXXDeconstructor, which can be kept in sync
with the entities it supports in the same package.

[TIP]
====
Whenever you modify any of the types that are processed by say a Deconstructor,
regenerate the Deconstructors for those types in that same package.

=== Self Registering Deconstructor.

[.lead]
The problem with the Deconstructor of the previous exercise is that the user class
must know the entity and the Deconstructor, to find a matching pair. +
Finding the entity type is easy, just ask the (non-null) entity for its type by using [blue]`Class<?> entity.getClass()`. +
Finding the Deconstructor is not as easy, certainly for a utility class that wants to turn any list of any kind of entity
into a csv file. +
The idea is then to use the entity to lookup the matching Deconstructor. This will loosen
up the coupling between classes and its users.

<div class='ex'><details open class='ex'><summary>Self-registering Deconstructor</summary>
++++

In this project you can use some of the code of the previous exercise, with a few tweaks.

Enhance the generated Deconstructor in the previous exercise to make it self registering.
To do that, make a static block that registers the generated Deconstructor, for instance the StudentDeconstructor.

* Make the generated Deconstructor extend the Deconstructor<E>, where E is the entityType of the requested Deconstronstructor. +
  E.g. [blue]`StudentDeconstructor extends Deconstructor<Student>`.
** This make the generated Deconstructor a link:week04.html#_design_for_extension_and_reusing_generics_tests[leaf class].
* Make the constructor or the generated Deconstructor [blue]`private`.
* Add the self registering static block.
* The deconstruct method can be the same as that from the previous exercise.
* and lastly, make the deconstruct method non-static, because you cannot overwrite static methods,
but need a normal method in the leaf class.

While developing, use the new generator to generate a few deconstuctors,
and see if the deconstructors work, by enabling the DeconstructorTest in the sampleentities test package.
