== Java Platform Module System.

The Java Platform Module System has been introduced with Java 9 and had a long development history at
the point of introduction. For the Java developers at Oracle and others involved in the OpenJDK project it
was considered a necessary step to make Java fit for the future and make it possible to shed some old
nasty problems. In the development of Java there have been only a few *major* release, although each release of
Java introduces new features that are supposed to play nice with what is already available. This is called forward
and backward compatibility, so old programs keep working but can be maintained by using new features.

The important major releases were:

* Java 1. Duh.
* Java 1.2 introducing the collection framework.
* Java 5 introduces Generics and the first version of the concurrency framework. It also changed the naming scheme. Internally it still is Java 1.5.
* Java 8 introduced a functional style of programming using Functional interfaces and lambda expressions
* Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System, and the project under which it came into being was called *JigSaw*. +
  That last name points to the idea of taking the JDK and run-time library apart and recompose it using a better partitioning,
 actually applying separation of concerns in a big way. The project has been a multi year undertaking.

The changes provide the following advantages for the Java platform developers (from https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw[project jigsaw])

* Make it easier for developers to construct and maintain libraries and large applications;
* Improve the security and maintainability of Java SE Platform Implementations in general, and the JDK in particular;
* Enable improved application performance; and
* Enable the Java SE Platform, and the JDK, to scale down for use in small computing devices and dense cloud deployments.

As always with Java, the intent is that the new Java release (9) should be able to work very much the same as the earlier versions, and it does, without
problems. If you use the JVM and JDK in [blue]*classpath* mode, it works very much like older versions. You define the jar files you need for you app and off you go.

Although the intent always has been to make the transition as smooth as possible, when you want to use the module system to the fullest,
it has some consequences.

* Not everything in the JDK can be used in the same way as before, more protection is taking place as are checks.
* A module is *closed* by default and must explicitly export [blue]##package##s, if they are needed from outside the module.
* The classes in a module can't be reflected on by default. If that is needed, the package must be made [blue]##open##ed for reflection.
* At the moment of writing these restrictions can be modified with startup flags of the JVM. Later Java releases may change the default settings,
from rather permissive in Java 9 to more restricted in later releases. As an example, some settings became more strict with
Java 16 and https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/396[JEP 396 Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default].

Having a modular project or a non-modular project depends on the presence of a small file with a well defined name in a specific place.

The module-info.java file should reside in the root folder of the java sources (which makes the defaul package). The name of the file
is not a valid java type name and that is on purpose. The resulting class file contains the module declarations
which specifies what a module *needs* (_reads_ in JPMS terms) and what it provides (exports).

The keywords specific to the module declaration are

* [blue]#exports# What the module provides. Use with one package per line.
* [blue]#module# starts the declaration
* [blue]#open# if before the module, opens the whole module for reflection.
  For instance for a module that defines all entities of a multi-module application.
* [blue]#opens# allows reflection of a package. Use with one per package per line.
* [blue]#provides# To indicate that a module implements some interface with one or more implementations.
* [blue]#requires# Indicates what the module itself needs or *reads*. One package per line.
* [blue]#transitive# Used with requires to indicate that there is a requirement that is then made readable to the users of this module as well.
* [blue]#to# Used to restrict either exports or opens to specific other module(s).
* [blue]#uses# To indicate that a module uses a service [blue]##provide##d by another module.
* [blue]#with# Used with provides to indicate which implementation(s) are available for the
  provided interface implementation. See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[Service Loader API].

As a rule, the module [blue]#java.base# is 'required' by default, the same a [blue]#java.lang# is available or imported by default, considering packages to import.

A few examples.

.Generic Mapper
[source,java]
----
module  nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericmapper {
    requires java.logging;
    requires nl.fontys.sebivenlo.sebiannotations;
    exports genericmapper;
}
----

.Generic DAO
[source,java]
----
module nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericdao {
    requires nl.fontys.sebivenlo.genericmapper;
    requires java.logging;
    requires java.sql;
    requires java.naming;
    requires org.postgresql.jdbc;
    requires nl.fontys.sebivenlo.sebiannotations;
    exports genericdao.dao;
    exports genericdao.memory;
    exports genericdao.pgdao;
}
----

.FXTriangulate
[source,java]
----
module fxtriangulate {
    requires javafx.controls;
    requires javafx.graphics;
    requires javafx.base;
    requires javafx.fxml;
    requires java.base;
    exports fxtriangulate ;
    opens fxtriangulate to javafx.fxml;
}
----

.The FXTriangulate client, Surveyor
[source,java]
----
module surveyor {
    requires java.logging;
    requires javafx.controls;
    requires javafx.graphics;
    requires javafx.base;
    requires javafx.fxml;
    requires fxtriangulate;
    exports surveyor;
    opens surveyor to javafx.fxml;
}
----

.ALDA sorting srevices
[source,java]
----
module sortingserviceapi {
    exports sortingservice; // <1>
}
// and
open module asortingservice {
    requires java.logging;
    requires sortingserviceapi;
    uses sortingservice.SortingServiceFactory; // <2>
    provides sortingservice.SortingServiceFactory with asortingservice.SortingServices; // <3>
}
----

<1> defines sortingservice.SortingServiceFactory in package sortingservice
<2> uses and
<3> provides Sorting Services presumably in tests.

[WARNING,BIG]
====
JPMS explicitely forbids:

* Split packages, that is using the same package name in different modules with different content.
* Cyclic dependencies as in A requires B requires A.
====

The dependencies are validated at the startup of the JVM, when you start Java.
If any of the requirements is not met, the JVM refuses to start. This has the benefit
that it is immediately obvious what is missing, instead of having a runtime error, when a class can't be found, because
the module has not been specified in the path, as is the case with the classpath mode.

The split package has been a bit of an issue for testing, because in a modern project, (business) source and tests are separated into
separate source trees, often with the same package structure, which looks a bit like split packages. The build tools (e.g. maven) understand
this and can organise the files such that the JVM accepts it anyway.

=== Changes in visibility

Java has always had the visibility modifiers [blue]#public#, [blue]#protected#, [blue]#default#, and [blue]#private#, in descending order of access.
This is still effective with the same rules _within_ a module. However the module boundaries add an extra line of visibility defense.
A public element from module A is only visible to elements in module B if the public elements is part of an exported package.
As far as reflection goes. An element in module A is accessible via reflection only if the package of the element is open (with the [blue]#opens# keyword)
either globally or explicitly to module B ( e.g. `module A { exports aPackage to B;}`).
