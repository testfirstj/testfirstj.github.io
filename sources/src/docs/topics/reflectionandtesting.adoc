==  Reflection and correcting student exams.

[big]#Not unit testing, but assessing the grades student get for their solutions.#

We teachers use reflection quite a bit when correcting the students' solutions to tasks in performance assessments.
This is also the way that the MOOC in PRC1 does parts of it's testing.
This is a special kind of unit testing, that is [red]*NOT* the norm, since it is utterly unsuited for TDD,
but serves as an illustration on what you can do with reflection.

As teacher / examiners

* We cannot expect that a class that the candidate should write is present.
* At the time of writing the tests the class certainly is not available. We therefore have
  to instantiate the objects using reflection.
* Sometimes the task states the requirement of only having a specific set of field types with specific visibility or other properties.
* We want the candidates to stick to the naming conventions.
* When you run the jacoco coverage plugin, jacoco itself adds so called _synthetic_ members, which
  are not found in the source code of the business class, but are added by jacoco by way of instrumentation,
  and we need to strip those out in our assessment of the students' code.
* We want to check that a method or field has the required visibility, [blue]##static##-ness, [blue]##final##ity, or [blue]##abstract##ness.
// This information is defined as the set of modifiers of the member, and implemented as a simple set of bits, packed in a int.

As an example verifying the visibility and other modifiers such as `static` and `final` may be subject
of the correction work we need to do.

In the java .class file, the [blue]#Modifier# of fields, methods, and of types such as classes and interfaces
are simply defined as a bit set packed into an `int`, and stored with the byte code in the class file.

The following modifiers are defined as follows:

[cols="<,^,>,^",header]
|====
| Modifier     | keyword       | int value |  Applies to
| PUBLIC       | `public`	       |    1      |  C, F, M
| PRIVATE      | `private`       |    2      |  C, F, M
| PROTECTED	   | `protected`     |    4      |  C, F, M
| STATIC	     | `static`        |    8      |  C, F, M
| FINAL	       | `final`         |   16      |  C, F, M
| SYNCHRONIZED | `synchronized`  |   32      |  M
| VOLATILE	   | `volatile`      |   64      |  F
| TRANSIENT	   | `transient`     |  128      |  F
| NATIVE	     | `native`        |  256      |  M
| INTERFACE	   | `interface`     |  512      |  C
| ABSTRACT	   | `abstract`      | 1024      |  C, M
| STRICT	     | `strict`        | 2048      |  C, M
|====

*Applies* to means **C**lass, **F**ield or **M**ethod.

*Note* that default or package private has no modifier bit of its own. If none of
`public`, `protected`, or `private` is set, then that is when you get the default.

As an example, a [blue]#public# final method has modifier [green]#1+16+1024 = 1041, or 0x411#.

Below you see a selection of the helper methods we use to correct performance assessments.
