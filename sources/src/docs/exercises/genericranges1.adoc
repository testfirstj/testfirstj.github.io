A *range* is a mathematical concept with quite a few applications in software systems.

* Availability of a person or resource according to some agenda.
* Booking resources like rooms in hotels or renting cars in a holiday.
* Computing prices of an arrangement or rent when it crosses different price-zones,
  like top-season or low-season.
* Computer memory inside the computer is a resource to be shared. It also can't
  overlap in the normal case, in particular not for data segments that are written by a program

The examples are often related to date or time, and are the most common use.
In the physical 3D world, the simple 1 dimensional linear model of ranges will not always be sufficient.

A range is some segment between two points. These points could be points on a number line or on a timeline.
Initially it looks like a simple concept, in particular a number line of say `long`, but in most physical
cases, the dimension of a *point* differ substantially of that of the distance between two points. To make the case,
you will find it natural to express a point in time as 1995-Aug-12 but you would wonder what exactly 6 * 25 August would mean.

This aspect is modeled in the Range [blue]*interface*, the type of the Points is *P*, the dimension between them with *D*. The mnemonic way
to remember is *P* for **p**oint in time, *D* for **D**istance. The **R**ange get the letter **R**.

An example of an (important) operation is expressed as a Functional interface called MeasureBetween, which provides the shape of
a lambda expression. `(P a, P b) -> D`, which says that the method computes the distance `D` between two `Points` `a` and `b`.

*Operations.*

* Compute the length of a Range as type Distance.
* Compute the distance between two points.
* Join and union to join two ranges producing a new Range.
* Intersection of two ranges, returning the overlap as Range.
* Divide into parts, such that a range is chopped up into 1, 2 or three parts (Ranges), dependent
  on the relative position of the operands in the operation. Useful to make reservations from available date or time ranges.

All tests use a limited set of test values, basically just points, *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, and *f*.
These are the same point as used in the diagrams.
A requirement to those points is that they are in ascending order [blue]`a < b < c < d < e < f`.

The ranges project is meant as a reusable library to define some ranges and operations on ranges.
The most important operation in this case is to compute the overlap between to ranges.
[[operations]]

The *contained* case is interesting one, because it can be used to determine if an availability matches a request.
For instance you want a 3 day holiday and the rooms that you can book must have a free range that contains your request.
If you then book, the free range is then cut up into a (optional) free part _before_, your booking, and an (optional) free part _after_.

The intersection operation in the ranges package is called `Range.intersectWith( Range other )` and is defined
_and_ implemented in the Range interface as a [blue]#default# method.
Because the Range interface is defined as a Generic type, the implementing classes can use the `intersectWith` method without change.

The same applies to methods `boolean overlaps(Range other)` and `D overlap(Range other)` which test if there [blue]#is# an overlap and
measure the length of such overlap.

The `Range intersectWith(Range other)` can be used to find conflicting ranges, but the information
you gain by this method is typically the same as `boolean overlaps(Range other)`. In a planning scenario you typically want to avoid overlaps.
You would not like to find other guests plundering your minibar.

The final operation, `D overlap(R other)` can be used  to compute prices. Use case: prices vary per season,
and the length of an overlap of a reservation with seasons determines the price of the parts.

Completely in line with the Duck example in the theory, we want maximum reuse, or
as much as possible work done in the Range super type, so that a specialization has little or no work to do.

Let us start simple and show what an integer range could look like when we get the design done.
The `IntegerRange` is also the first leaf class in our design.

.IntegerRange is a Range of Integer
[source,java]
----
public class IntegerRange implements Range<IntegerRange, Integer, Integer> {

    final Integer start;
    final Integer end;

    private IntegerRange( Integer[] p ) { // <1>
        this.start = p[ 0 ];
        this.end = p[ 1 ];
    }

    @Override
    public Integer start() {
        return start;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer end() {
        return end;
    }

    @Override
    public BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> meter() { // <2>
        return ( a, b ) -> b - a;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return rangeHashCode();
    }

    @Override
    @SuppressWarnings( "EqualsWhichDoesntCheckParameterClass" )
    public boolean equals( Object obj ) { // <3>
        return rangeEquals( obj );
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return rangeToString();
    }

    @Override
    public IntegerRange between( Integer start, Integer end ) { // <4>
        return IntegerRange.of( start, end );
    }

    public static of(Integer start, Integer end) {
        return new IntegerRange(  Range.minmax( start, end ) ); // <5>
    }
}
----

<1> Private helper constructor that takes an array of two T's
<2> This method returns a function in the form of a lambda expression
<3> The interface defines helper methods for equals and hashcode. Because you cannot
   overwrite methods of a class in an interface, we use this trick to avoid duplicate work or copy-and-waste-errors.
<4> Factory helper that can be used by the default methods in the Range interface
<5> Using helper method that ensures that parameters are passed in correct order.

.IntegerRange as Java 16+ feature, less boilerplate.
[source,java]
----
public record IntegerRange( Integer start, Integer end) implements
        Range<IntegerRange, Integer, Integer> {

    @Override
    public BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> meter() {
        return ( a, b ) -> b - a;
    }

    @Override
    public IntegerRange between( Integer start, Integer end ) {
        return new IntegerRange( start, end );
    }

    @Override
    public Integer zero() {
        return 0;
    }
}
----

[TIP]
====
When you want to enable java preview features with projects that use testeasypom,
set the #java.release# to the version you want to use, and
add a build section to tell the compiler to turn on the preview-features.
[source,xml]

   <java.release>16</java.release>

.The Range interface class header
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Range with start and end and some operations.
 *
 * @param <R> self referencing range type.
 * @param <P> the demarcation type of start and end point.
 * @param <D> the distance Dimension between start and end points.
 */
 public interface Range<R extends Range<R,P,D>,
                        P extends Comparable<? super P>,
                        D extends Comparable<? super D>
                        >
        extends Comparable<R>, Serializable {
// code omitted
}
----

The interface definition may look a bit daunting but it reads as: +
_a range which has subtypes [blue]`R`, and has two [blue]#Comparable# endpoints of type [blue]`P`, with distance of type [blue]`D` and is itself [blue]#Comparable#
  with something of it's own type [blue]`R`_.
The comparison is done by comparing the starting boundaries, a and c in the drawings above.

The type parameters are a bit special, because generic ranges may have endpoints of a different type
than the distance between them. Compare to two locations on earth. The location is expressed as https://www.latlong.net/[lat-long] which
is a two-dimensional value, but the distance is expressed as a length in meters, kilometers, or miles. +
Same for time and dates. A date is a position on some scale with an arbitrary origin, like the Gregorian Calendar,
but the 'distance' is not of type date, but of some
kind of time-duration such or `Period` of `Duration`. If you ask a Duration its 'length', you need to specify the unit, such
as `ChronoUnit.DAYS`, `ChronoUnit.HOURS` or `ChronoUnit.NANOS`.

The definition of the leaf class `LocalDateTimeRange` therefore looks like this:

[source,java]
----
public class LocalDateTimeRange implements Range<LocalDateRange, LocalDateTime, Duration> {
  // code omitted
}
----

The https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/ChronoUnit.html[ChronoUnit ^]
allows the range to be measured in any of the unit types defined in that `enum`, from nano seconds to centuries, with days somewhere in between.
Not all units are applicable all of the time. HOURS and DAYS are precise, but MONTHS and YEARS are not, because they vary in length.

The interesting or special methods defined in the interface may also need some explanation.

.Between. Note that [blue]*a* is included, [red]*b* is excluded in the range a-b
[source,java]
----
 /**
   * Is a midpoint between a (inclusive) and b (exclusive).
   *
   * @param a first point
   * @param b second
   * @param inBetween point
   * @return true if inBetween is at or after a and strictly before b.
   */
  default boolean isBetween( P a, P b, P inBetween ) {
      return a.compareTo( inBetween ) <= 0 && inBetween.compareTo( b ) < 0;
  }
----

.Do two ranges have points in common?
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Does this range overlap with another one.
 *
 * @param other to check
 * @return true on overlap with other
 */
default boolean overlaps( R other ) {
    // code left as exercise
}
----

.The getLength() method evaluates the method returned by the meter() method implemented in the above class.
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Get the length of this range in some unit. The effective operation is
 * (end - start), but since we do not know how to subtract the sub-types,
 * that is left to the implementer. The exception thrown on incompatibility
 * of range and unit is also left to the implementer.
 *
 * @param unit of measurement
 * @return the length
 * @throws RuntimeException when the unit and this range are not compatible
 */
default long getLength( D unit ) {
    return meter().apply( this.start(), this.end() );
}
----

The [blue]`default` method above uses the abstract method below.

.The measurement [blue]_device_ is a BiFunction<P,P,D> that is applied in the above method.
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Return the 'device' to measure the distance between two points Compute the distance in dimension D.
     * The implementer has the choice to return a class, lambda expression, or a (static) method reference.
     * The lambda has two inputs of type P: a and b.
     *
     * @return the distance meter lambda or BiFunction Implementation.
     */
    BiFunction<P,P,D> meter();
}
----


.One of methods that makes the Range interface and its sub-classes worth their keep.
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Compute the length that this and an other range overlap.
 *
 * @param other range
 * @param unit of measurement
 * @return the length of the overlap as a number of 'long' units
 */
default D overlap( R other ) {
   // sorry, this is your work. And 0 is wrong most of the time.
}
----

[[punchthrough]]
image::punchthrough.svg[title='The punch only punches if it has a full hit']

.The punching on test stage as shown in figure <<punchthrough>>
[source,java]
----
   Stream<Range<R, T, U>> result = range.punchThrough( punch ); // <1>
   assertThat( result )
        .as( "punch " + range + " with " + punch )
        .containsExactlyElementsOf( expectedParts );
----

<1> Note that the punch operation takes a single `Range punch` but produces a Stream that contains +
* Either the 'green' range as a whole, in case the punch 'missed', or more formally is not completely contained in the target,
* part(s) of the green range and the punch as a whole,
* or only the punch if it completely knocks out and thereby replaces the green range. In this last case the punch and target completely overlap.

From the above you can infer that the resulting [blue]`Stream` from the [blue]#punchThrough# operation has at least one (1) element and at most three (3).

[TIP]
====
Whenever a method produces a Stream from an element of a Stream with a single operation,
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html#flatMap(java.util.function.Function)[flatMap]
 is your friend.
====

*Parameterized Tests* +
Many of the tests in the Ranges project are parameterized.
Test driven in this instance means adding a row of test data to the data source, or un-comment a row.

In this first part you need to complete the Range and RangeTest in the given project using the IntegerRange as leaf class.
