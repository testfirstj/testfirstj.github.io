== Exercise OlifantysBalls

[CAUTION]
====
Mockito is a very powerful tool and serves the developer best when you stick
to the rule of not writing code that is not executed. This applies to stubbing and mocking as well.
When you stub or mock something, that fact serves as a kind of documentation for the developer or
maintainer of the code and by implication of the tests as well. So if you apply stubbing and get a warning,
do not just simply turn of the warning, but also document the potential unneeded stubbing.

There are situations where you must compromise between the strictness of Mockito and
the convenience of other aspects of a test approach. One such case is applicable to the GumballStateTest,
where we use one test table as external test data. This test data is used in all tests. Changing the test data
to just including the exactly right stubbing or mocking would make the test data set bigger, and thereby
less easy to comprehend.

In the exercise below we applied the annotation +
 [blue]`@MockitoSettings( strictness = Strictness.WARN )` +
 on two methods, where a specific interaction does not take place with all test data.

[big red]*TURN of Warnings only, once you have verified that the path you tread is safe given the conditions of the tests*

// Working through this project gave me some new insights and made me realize that
// there is much sense in demonstrating things to students.

In this exercise you will test driven develop the behavior of a gumball machine.
You will be implementing a state machine using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern[GoF State Pattern ^].
The machine has following events:

* [blue]`insertCoin()`,
* [blue]`ejectCoin(...)`,
* [blue]`refill(...)`,
* and [blue]`draw(...)` +
    which can be understood as events, modeled in the interface [blue]`State` and should
    therefore have an implementation in each state.

and four states:

** [blue]`SOLD_OUT`,
** [blue]`NO_COIN`,
** [blue]`HAS_COIN`
** and [blue]`WINNER`.

[[state_diagram]]
.state diagram of the gumball machine.
image::statemachine.svg[State machine]

Study the state diagram, it is the (whole) specification of our gumball system.

You should find that the system starts in the state

* *SOLD_OUT*, and will go to *NO_COIN* after a refill
  with some gumballs.
* When you insert a coin, it goes to *HAS_COIN*, in which you can draw to get a ball.
* If the machine becomes empty by a draw, it will go to *SOLD_OUT*,
* If not and you are lucky because the winner guard is true, the state is *WINNER* in which you can draw another ball without extra payment.
* If not winner or after the extra draw the system will go back to *NO_COIN*, waiting for the next coin insertion.
** As last detail, when after *WINNER* the machine becomes empty because draw takes the last ball, the system will go to the *SOLD_OUT* out state.

[[context]]

image::gumball-context.svg[Context]


Because both the Java artefacts `Context` and `State` in the initial design are
interfaces, we've added the UML `public` visibility modifier to all methods,
because that is how interfaces work in Java.

The circled plusses near StateEnum is the UML way of saying that SOLD_OUT etc are inner classes of StateEnum, which they effectively are.

The `OlifantysBallMachine` implements two interfaces with the exact purpose of

* `GumBallApi` being the public API for consumption by the client and the
* `Context` interface as one of the collaborators in the state pattern.

To keep the API simple, that interface has one public static method for the client to get an instance of the package private OlifantysBallMachine.
This keeps our design nice and tidy with the least possible coupling and leakage of unneeded information to the client. See it as an example of a clean design.

The behavior is easily modeled in a state diagram, but can also be expressed in a _state transition table_, which has exactly the same
information with the added benefit that it can easily be understood by a program, in our case the tests of the state machine.
Using such state transition table is an older technique than the state machine diagrams.
It predates UML, but is still valuable, in particular because it will easily list all
possibile states and thus will help to find more test cases, ensuring that the set of tests is complete.

[TIP]
====
image:gumballmachine-thumb.png[role="thumb left", title="gumball machine",200]
In a real machine or automaton, such as a vending machine, the state machine will control one or
more devices. As an example, think of a coffee brewer, which must grind coffee, maybe dispense cups,
boil water and brew the coffee by pressing the water through the ground coffee, thereby filling the cup. To work properly, these
'devices', such as boiler, grinder, cup dispenser, and pump need to be switched on and off. This is best done on enter (turn on) and
exit (turn off) of the state, and is the reason why the State interface provides these methods. They are not used in the gumball exercise because there
is no device, only imaginary, but might be used in a future exercise or project. A properly programmed context must therefor call the
`enter(...)` and `exit(...)` methods when changing state, and a context test should verify that.
====

*Test data in a table*
In the table below, `empty` and `winner` are _guard expressions_, with the outcome specified for the moment of evaluation. Guard expressions
have a state decide if it should react to the trigger (guard == true) or not. A guard comes from outside the state and is typically available on the context, as in this exercise.
Where the guard is not relevant, it is set to false. Nicer would have been leave the guard's table cell empty when it is not relevant but that does not
play very well with junit csv tests and would complicate the tests. Another approach would be to have a line each for each of the possible guard values, to ensure that guard
really does not have effect in specific cases.

For the column *End State*, empty means no state change.

[[StateTable]]
[format="csv", options="header,small"]

include::{topics}/solution/olifantysballs/src/test/resources/olifantysballs/testtable.csv[]
|===

We will start testing the state enum `StateEnum`.

The table reiterates that the state `HAS_COIN` needs the most attention in testing. +
Also note that this table is just the specification, just like the state diagram,
and not the implementation.

To get our `State` tested without any real machine nearby, we must mock out `Context`.
This can be done by hand, but would soon make us create a context implementation that sort of works, but

 * first of all, is not tested itself, thus violates the TDD workflow
 * does not behave the way we need it in the test for the `State` type
 * and we do not need to have this context to behave in any way other
 then to give predictable answers when called by the State, and we must
 ensure that the State has the exact interactions we want. Not too few, and also not too many.

This is where http://mockito.org[Mockito ^] comes in. We only use a few of its features, namely

* the mocking facility,
* recording and playback of method calls and return values
* verification of the correct calls on the mocked Context.

Our setup looks as follows:

[[Mock-setup]]
.preparing for tests: setup.
[source,java]
----
    @Mock
    final Context ctx; // <1>

    StringOutput sout = new StringOutput(); // <2>
    PrintStream out = sout.asPrintStream(); // <3>

    /**
     * Map the trigger name from the csv file to a lambda expression of type
     * {@code BiConsumer<Context,State>}.
     */
    static Map<String, BiConsumer<Context, State>> triggerMap = Map.of( // <4>
            "insertCoin", ( c, s ) -> s.insertCoin( c ),
            "ejectCoin", ( c, s ) -> s.ejectCoin( c ),
            "drawBall", ( c, s ) -> s.draw( c ),
            "refill", ( c, s ) -> s.refill( c, 5 )
    );

    void setupMocks() { // <5>
        when( ctx.getOutput() ).thenReturn( out );
        // any colour will do.
        when( ctx.dispense() ).thenReturn( new OlifantysGumball( "RED" ) );
    }
----

<1> The context is mocked in the constructor
<2> StringOuput and PrintStream are combined into a PrintStream that takes the role of system output.
<3> Creates a `StringOutput` and
   ensure that anything output by the context is returned in an easily
  interpreted `String`.
<4> translates strings to actual lambda expressions that do the interaction in the test.
<5> Is the setup the standard mocks are trained to return the appropriate things on specific method calls.

This basic setup is done for every test anew and makes sure our SUT has a fresh
collaborator every time, ignorant of what happened in earlier tests.

*First test*

The tabular form of the state machine behavior above is taken as the input form the parameterized tests.

First we get the initial state from the csv test  source, which is in the column name "Start State".
Because we need a State enum value we need to look that up using the enum classes' `values()` method.

When a state method is invoked, it can or should have multiple interactions with the
context. To test that, we use the mocked context. First we need to complete it's teaching, that
is what to answer on the boolean methods  `isEmpty()` and `isWinner()`. We take the values from the two columns winner and empty

image::seq_draw.svg[role="thumb right",title="sequence diagram of draw"]
Here is an example a first test: Make sure the machine does not return any ball(s)
when it's state is `NO_COIN`. From the <<state_diagram>> we learn that the action
`draw()` should only be effective in the state `HAS_COIN`. This gives the
interaction, modeled in the sequence diagram below. The dispense method should only be called in specif states.


As can be seen in the sequence diagram, the `dispense()` call is only allowed in
the state `HAS_COIN`, not in `NO_COIN`. Let the test `verify` that using a mockito
verify. A Mockito `verify` is similar to a JUnit `assertXXX`, it will complain (in Java terms:
throw an Assert Exception), that a dispense() is NOT happening.

[[First-Test]]
.first test
[source,java]
----
    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvFileSource( resources = { "testtable.csv" } )
    public void verifyDispense(
            int nr, String initialStateName, String finalStateName,
            String triggerName, boolean empty, boolean winner,
            int dispenseCount, int addBallsCount, String expectedText ) {

        State initialState = StateEnum.valueOf( initialStateName ); // <1>
        var triggerAction = triggerMap.get( triggerName );          // <2>

        // prime collaborator
        when( ctx.isEmpty() ).thenReturn( empty );                  // <3>
        when( ctx.isWinner() ).thenReturn( winner );                // <4>

        triggerAction.accept( ctx, initialState );                  // <5>

        verify( ctx, times( dispenseCount ) ).dispense();           // <6>
    }
----

<1> Select the appropriate instance of the State.
<2> Lookup the interaction in the 'lambda' map, which translates strings to BiConsumer of Context and State.
<3> Read the values empty and
<4> winner from the table and use them to train the mocked context.
<5> Do the interaction
<6> verify the the number of dispenses matches the requirement, in the NO_COIN state 0.

CsvFileSourceStateTest has in total 4 tests which assert all stated requirements in the table.

*assertMessage* that verifies that the correct output is 'printed' +
*verifyDispense* ensures that the exact number of balls is dispensed, 0 or 1. +
*verifyRefillAddsBalls* that some balls are added to the machine when refill is called +
*verifyStateTransition* does what the name says.

*Do not forget the context.*

The context's implementation becomes surprisingly simple.
It only needs to forward the  event or 'trigger' to the current state, which in turn
will tell the context what to do.


The context must provide a bit of functionality to make the actions directed by the states meaningful.

* forward the trigger to the state, providing itself as the first parameter. For instance
  `insertCoin()` in the API should result in an `insertCoin(Context) call in the state.
* Remember what state the context is 'in'. We do that with the changeState method.
* invoke the exit and enter method when we swicth between states.
* invoke the enter method on the initial state.

and a few more.
These test bodies are given in the test class 'OlifantysMachineImpleTest' with their purpose,
so you should be able to fill in the blanks.


*How about coverage* +
Some of the tests in OlifantysMachineImpleTest are there for the purpose of maintaining
a high coverage. Since you are already familiar with test coverage, it simply is a matter
of turning on the proper maven profile.

[TIP]
====
The csv test data are in a separate resource folder. If you try to test just one file,
make sure you do *test project first*, which makes maven copy over the csv file to a place where
the unit test can find it.
