=== Class Genealogy

In the following exercise you will use the information that is available
in the Class object. You will find the interfaces, super classes, and interfaces implemented by the super classe and the class
as well as the fields that are defined in each of the classes in the field hierarchy.

Your task is to create a program that lists the class hierarchy of class names given on
the command line.

The output should be a tree-like structure with `Object` at the top and
the `named class` at the bottom and all intermediate `super classes` in
between in proper order. For every level in the hierarchy, add two spaces for indentation.
At the end the program of the hierarchy it should show the non-static fields that are
defined in all classes in the hierarchy with the modifiers in the order of definition.

To get a class object you can use `Class.forName(String name)` which, if
the class is loadable by the JVM, is loaded.

As usual, start with writing the tests. The test class has two tests:

. One to show the genealogy of the Genealogy class itself.
. One to show the class hierarchy of `javax.swing.JButton`.

The picture only shows the direct lines of ancestry, not the interfaces. In this task you
should show the implemented interfaces plus the fields.

The elements (or supertypes, i.e. super classes and interfaces) that should be contained in the `javax.swing.JButton` are:

[cols="1"]
|====
|java.lang.Object
|java.awt.Component
|java.awt.image.ImageObserver
|java.awt.MenuContainer
|java.io.Serializable
|java.awt.Container
|javax.swing.JComponent
|javax.swing.TransferHandler$HasGetTransferHandler
|javax.swing.AbstractButton
|java.awt.ItemSelectable
|javax.swing.SwingConstants
|javax.swing.JButton
|javax.accessibility.Accessible
|====

At the bottom of the hierarchy we want all _non-static_ *Declared* [blue]*fields* in the class hierarchy in declaration order,
that is in order from the top of the hierarchy to the bottom and within the classes in field order.

.To determine if a field is non-statid use
[source,java]
----
Predicate<Field> nonStatic = ( Field f ) -> !Modifier.isStatic( f.getModifiers() );
----

When you ask an interface for its modifier, it will say INTERFACE ABSTRACT, which is not very informative.
So it would be better to only show the visibility of a type and field.
Visibility is encoded in the lower three bits of the type or member Modifier,
meaning that `String visibility = Modifier.tostring( m.getModifiers() & ( 7+16 ));` produces
the visibility and finality in string form.

In the project you will find some sample classes to test your application with.

Testing can be done by using `assertThat(String).contains(String....)`.
Doing so will get a quick full coverage, but testing the exact result may be a bit tricky.

Formatting test can be done with your eye-balls.

You do [green]#not# have to test the sample classes.

.Example output for `java.lang.StringBuilder`
[source,text]
----
$ ./run.sh java.lang.StringBuilder
class hierarchy of [java.lang.StringBuilder]
 public java.lang.Object
   abstract java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder  implements public java.lang.Appendable, public java.lang.CharSequence
     public final java.lang.StringBuilder  implements public java.io.Serializable, public java.lang.Comparable
//declared fields:
{
     byte[] value  // declared in: AbstractStringBuilder
   , byte coder  // declared in: AbstractStringBuilder
   , int count  // declared in: AbstractStringBuilder
}
----

Note that the fields are package private, and declared in a [blue]#package private# class, the `AbstractStringBuilder`.
If you run the program on `java.lang.StringBuffer` and see almost the same. This is because these two classes are siblings
sharing the same immediate parent class, the package private AbstractStringBuilder, which does most of the actual work.
