=== Exercise LambdaLibrary

++++
<div class='ex'><details open class='ex'><summary class='ex'>Lambda Library</summary>

Within this assignment you will get more familiar with the syntax of lambda expressions, as well as how to apply them.
You will use the *streams* to get some work with collections done in a smart way.

[NOTE]
====
Note: to run the FX application, don't click "run" in Netbeans. Assuming you are using a sebipom based project, then
link:../2020/tips.html#_sebipom_and_java_fx[first enable the fx profile ^], then right click the project and either

* select 'Run maven' and select exec _or_
* in the Navigator, right-click the 'javafx run' entry and select 'execute goal'.
====


.The FX application works out of the box and you should not touch any of the FX parts. You will only work on the library itself.

Your task is to implement the business logic for a library. This library
      provides some methods to get access to the books and to retrieve several views
      on that books. A simple swing-GUI which displays the books of the library is given.
      You can use that to see parts of your implementation in action.

As usually, you will find an NetBeans project for this assignment inserted in you subversion repository.
Note that the project will run, but not all functionality is implemented, yet. Proceed in the following
      steps:

. Start working on this assignment by studying the Javadoc which is given.
 Take especially care of the class `LibraryModel` since this will form the requirements you will have to implement.
. Implement one of the test cases in the test class `LibraryModelTest`.
 	A good starting point is the `testGetBooks()` method.
. Implement the method for which you wrote the test(s) in the previous step.
** It may need more tests if a method has more aspects to fulfill. Each aspect could have a different test. +
 It is quite common to have more test methods per business method.
. Repeat the steps 2 and 3 until all functionality is implemented.

Note that this task has a dependence on the previous task cvsobjects, to read a csv file
as book objects.


Additional information on lambda expressions and the java 8 features can be
    found at the following locations:

link:{apidocs}/lambdalibrary/index.html[javadoc of the application].
This provides the requirements of all the methods to be tested and implemented. You can derive your test data from the `library.csv} file.

*Update* The provided test class has two methods called book(int) and books(int ...), where the parameter is called id or ids. This could lead
to confusion, when you interpret that as the id of the book in the csv file. It is not that number but simply the index in the List of books, so starts
at 0, not 1.
