=== Generating code using Templates

In the Java versions before Java 16, generating source code could be a bit tedious,
because in Java a String can't contain line breaks, that is a line cannot be multiple lines lone with only one set of quotes.
The Java 14+ text block feature solves that, and is final in Java 16, but we will deal with it here anyway.

If you know what your code looks like, your can put it in a file, maybe even starting
by copying from an existing java class. The template below is created that way and has our advised code style.


.Assume your template text looks like
[source]
----
package %1$s;

import deconstructorregistry.Deconstructor;
/**
 * This is generated code. Do not edit, your changes will be lost.
 */
public class %2$sDeconstructor {

    /**
     * The purpose of self registration is not being able to
     * create new instances, other then by the class loader.
     */
    private %2$sDeconstructor() {
    }

    static {
        Mapper.register( %2$s.class, new %2$sDeconstructor() );
    }

    /**
     * Deconstruct an entity into an array.
     * @param %2$s the victim
     */
    @Override
    public Object[] deconstruct(  %2$s %3$s ) {
       return new Object[]{
            %4$s
       };
    }
}
----

In the template you see special 'tokens' like `%2ss`, which means: use the second parameter, and interpret as string.
In this case the template specifies 4 parameters:

. is the package name,
. is the entity type name,
. is the parameter name of the deconstructor method
. is the the place where the list of getters should land.

.Reading the template from a file and put it in a String constant.
[source,java]
----
    private static String templateText( String templateName ) {
        String text = "";
        Class clz = Constants.class;

        try ( InputStream in = clz.getResourceAsStream( templateName ) ) {
            text = new String( in.readAllBytes​() );
        } catch ( IOException ex ) {
            Logger.getLogger( Constants.class.getName() )
                    .log( Level.SEVERE, ex.getMessage() );
        }
        return text;
    }
    public static String CODE_TEMPLATE = templateText(
            "CodeTemplate-java.txt" );
----

.Use the template with the positional parameters.
[source,java]
----
    String classText = String.format( CODE_TEMPLATE,
            GENERATED_PACKAGE, // <1>
            typeName, // <2>
            paramName, // <3>
            getters( entityType ) // <4>
    );
----

<1> Parameters to
<2> the
<3> template
<4> as explained above.

=== Entity Deconstructor Generator

[.lead]
Some of the operations you want to do on entities do not belong to the responsibility of
the entity. As an example: providing various external representations, such as
a list of entities as a csv (comma separated value) file. It is not the entities responsibility to format its
information in every possible format. Often the toString() method is not really fit for business but mainly meant for debugging.
You use an external class to achieve a specific format. The EntityDeconstructor is such a helper for
the simplest cases, such a simple csv. Writing such helper class can be largely automated, taking most of the
boilerplate coding away from the easily bored but 😎 programmer.

<div class='ex'><details open class='ex'><summary class='ex'>Entity Deconstructor</summary>
++++

[big]*This exercise has two parts, the generator and the registry, so the generator generates code that fits the registry exercise*

To ease the handling of handling _entities_ in a business application, a deconstructor method is a _nice to have_.

A *deconstructor* takes an [blue]#entity# and returns an array of [blue]##Object##s containing all fields of the entity.

This allows things such as getting the data to create a csv representation without having to do that inside the entity class.
In the last exercises in this part you will use even more information, so you can create things such as json format, yaml,
or fill a prepared statement when you want to put entities into a database using jdbc (which we will do next week).

.example usage
[source,java]
----
  for( Object fieldValue: deconstruct( student )) {
     // do something with the field value
  }
----

This deconstructor is not automatically provided by the IDE, and it takes a bit of wrestling with the editor.
Why not _generate_ a deconstructor from the information that is in the class-object of the entity?

A deconstructor would have the following API, with the Student as example:

.Given a student entity:
[source,java]
----
class Student{
    private final Integer snummer;
    private final String lastname;
    //...
    private final Boolean active;
    // rest left out

    // methods left out
}
----

.the [blue]#StudentDeconstructor# could look like this (abbreviated).
[source,java]
----
public class StudentDeconstructor {

  public static Object[] deconstruct( Student s ) {
    return new Object[]{
        s.getSnummer(),
        s.getLastname(),
       // some left out for brevity
       s.getActive()
    };
  }
}
----

The generated deconstructor is specialized for the Student class, and it is really fast.

In this exercise you will create the deconstructor java code given the entity class name on the command line.

[source]
----
    generateDeconstructor sampleentities.Student > path/to/StudentDeconstructor.java
----

*The fine print*

* The generated code must be a valid class, and be acceptable by the java compiler.
* The parameter on the command line is the fully qualified entity name such as `sampleentities.Student`.
** Use Class.forName(String) to try to load the class.
* The package declaration should be the same as that of the entity.
* The entity classes should be available in binary form so we can reflect on them.
* The name of the Deconstructor type should be the name of the entity type with `"Deconstructor"` appended. E.g. [green]#StudentDeconstructor#.
* The type and signature of the deconstructor method should be `public static Object[] deconstructor( EntityType )`,
  like  `public static Object[] deconstructor( Student )`.
* The field values should be obtained using the getter for the field. Assume *'get'* as prefix for all methods
* The getter should be constructed according to the convention, `get+<fieldname with first letter capitalized>`. E.g the getter for field `firstname` is get**F**irstname.
* The values obtained by the getters should be placed in the order of field declaration of the entity type.
* The generated code should be fit for human consumption, with reasonable indentation so that eye-ball inspection of the generated code is meaningful.

In the project you will find a pre-made set of tests in which you have to add some test data and
details of the tests.

In the tests:

* Remove all _unneeded_footnote:[the white space is there to improve redability, but is the first that can be discarded, which is what a compiler does as one of the first steps]
 white space. This can be done easily with: +
  [blue]`stream().map (line -> line.trim()).filter(l -> !l.isEpmty())`.
  This trick has been packed in a method called cleanCode that takes the whole generated text, cleans it and returns it as a list of Strings.
* Test each aspect with a separate test data line. Use the `Student` class, which is given in the `sampleentities` package.


// generator needs entities on class path!.
.Windows run script to run the entitydeconstructor from the command line. Called run.cmd
[source,cmd]
----
@echo off

set jar=target/entitydeconstructor-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
if not exist %jar% cls & echo Maven... & call mvn package
echo.
java -jar %jar% %*
----

.bash script to do the same as the above. Will work in git-bash too.
