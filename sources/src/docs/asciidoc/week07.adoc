//Simple DAO using direct object manipulation.

// Generic DAO using helpers with entity classes and prescribed constructor. Compare to java 14+ records.
// Dash of reflection to get field names, field types and annotations.
//
// Approach: per entity, get list of field names and field types to find the correct constructor, to create an entity from a db record.
// In the entity class or helper class, have a "deconstructor" that returns all fields as one array.
// If the helper lives in the same package (it could be the dao), it can have access to package private info of the class, which
// simplifies fidling with access etc.
