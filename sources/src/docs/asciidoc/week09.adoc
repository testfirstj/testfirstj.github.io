== Other uses of State Machines

State machines or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton[Automaton]s are not only of interest
in actual vending machines or toys, but also in many other problems in the computer science domain.
One such application is that of regular expressions. Another is what compilers do when
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis[Lexing] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing[Parsing] the source code.

== State machines and regular expressions

You can find a lot on the relation between state machines and regular expressions.
In most cases, including in Java, the regex is translated or compiled into a statemachine (just) before matches are attempted.

A nice illustration is given by the
https://regexper.com/[REGEXPER] website, that turns a regex into a railroad diagram. This make the understanding of a regular expression way easier.

//http://ivanzuzak.info/noam/webapps/fsm_simulator/[Finite State Machine Simulator] by Ivan Zuzak.


A simple regex : Dutch postal code: `"\d{4}\s[A-Z]{2}"`

.with diagram

The postcode railroad diagram reads as a digit followed by 3 more digits, a space, a letter and one more letter.


.More complex example:
[source,java]
----
// note that you can break off the regex in java and intersperse it with comments.
String emailRegex="^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&''*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+"+ // quite some rubish before the at sign
     "@"+ // the at sign followed by a more restricted set of chars,
          //  with some lengths restrictions
     "[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?"+ // optional non capt grp
     // any number of letter-number combos
     "(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$";
----

.Produces this 'railroad' diagram. which is equivalent to a state machine diagram.

Note that there is not one TRUE regex for email addresses. If you want to know the nitty-gritty details
of valid email addresses look at RFC 8398 or RFC 5322, or ask in CSAR class.

[WARNING]
====
Once you understand that regexes are state machine specifications, and that is is easy to create state machines
that never 'terminate', you understand that regular expressions can also be dangerous.

Accepting a regular expression
from any source may cause a denial of service attack, because such expression may put your server into an endless loop.

Advice: only accept a restricted set of regexes, maybe parse them before use. In particular avoid back tracking constructs.
