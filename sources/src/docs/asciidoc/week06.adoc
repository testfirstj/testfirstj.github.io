.Use standard techniques
****
In cooking, working with traditional techniques often provides the best results.
The recipes have had the most testing and have been optimized over time. Compare to cooking with water.
We know the properties of cooking in water well: The maximum temperature is more
or less self regulating (as long as there is water in the cauldron) and under otherwise
similar conditions such as pressure, the result is pretty much predictable and almost risk-free.

The same with programming. The techniques shown in this part about reflection should [big red]*NOT* be used on a daily basis but
be reserved for special cases, such as making a tool set (maybe called a framework), that can then make working on standard recipes
a bit more efficient for the programmer.
Frameworks typically pay their keep with a little performance degradation, because they need some extra work either at application startup,
in preparation of the executable, when used or all of the former.

If the use of a framework makes the normal programming more complex, you might want to consider [big red]*not* using it. +
In all cases, you should be aware of the consequences.
